Following samples were removed from further analyses, due to bad quality of the size standard and/or fragment run:  
## PCR_numbers: 988, 1020, 1028, 1044, 1052; 
## correspond to samples: 0_unfed_2b, 28_unfed_1a, 28_fed_1c, Chitin_10,6mg_1a, Chitin_106mg_1c 


Files: 

Binned_wcontrols 	- sample x OTU table including PCR replicates and controls (Note: last column repeats sample IDs; needs to be removed for further analyses)

ARISA_merged 		- sample x OTU table with merged PCR replicates, includes controls  

EnvData_triplicates	- metadata table for binned, but non-merged data (Binned_wcontrols) 
EnvData_merged 		- metadata table for merged data (ARISA_merged)

Note: controls include positive and negative PCR controls, as well as extracts of chitin powder. In addition a t0 was measured before sediments were fed.
