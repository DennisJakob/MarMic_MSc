The mean of replicate data (per sampling site and per dilution) was used. → CFU per plate
The mean was divided by number of pins. → CFU per microliter dilution
CFU per microliter was multiplied by 1000. → CFU per mililiter dilution
CFU per mililiter was multiplied by the dilution factor. → CFU per mililiter seawater

Data are saved in culturability_abs.txt as absulte numbers per mililiter seawater.
Data are further saved as relative numbers per mililiter seawater in percent. (Ref ~ 10^6 cells / mililiter seawater) → culturability_rel.txt
