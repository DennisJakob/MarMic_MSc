NMDS exercise
1) Perform an NMDS analysis using the varespec dataset, based on the Bray-Curtis distance (see ?metaMDS).

2) Plot the results. What can you say about the different sampling sites?

3) Did the algorithm converge?

4) Construct four NMDS varying from 1 to 4 the number of dimensions allowed, and make a plot of the stress values vs the number of dimensions.

5) Perform a Shepard plot. (see ?stressplot).
