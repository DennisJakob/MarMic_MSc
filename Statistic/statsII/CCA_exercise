CCA exercise
1) What is the difference between the CCA and RDA?

2) Perform a CCA on the varespec and varchem datasets (response and explanatory respectively).

3) Make a triplot (objects, and response and explanatory variables) for the first two canonical axes.
 3.1) How much inertia is captured by these axes?
 
4) What are the values of the constrained and total inertia? What does this mean? What is inertia in this case (compare it to the inertia reported in your RDA object).

5) What is the correlation between the first canonical axes and the explanatory matrix?

6) Test the significance of the overall solution and for the first two axes.
