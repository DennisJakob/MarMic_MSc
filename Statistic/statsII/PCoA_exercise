PCoA exercise

1) Compute a distance matrix for the varespec dataset based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure.

2) Perform a PCoA on the distance matrix and the plot the first two axes.

3) Inspect the eigenvalues of the PCoA axes. Is there something unexpected?

4) Make an appropriate transformation of the distance matrix, apply PCoA and repeat tasks 1 to 3.

5) What happens if the distance matrix is based on Euclidean distance?
