# An ecologically-flavoured introduction to statistics

## Goal
acquire an intuition about statistical methods: their nature, usage scenarios, and limitations

## literature
- Galileo Galilei - Il saggiatore
- Sally Calrdwell - Statisctics unplugged
- David Fredman, Robert Pisani, Roger Purves - Statistics
- Darrell Huff - How to lie with statistics
- Shannons theory of information (degree of surprise / contrast)

## Definitions
### Statistic
A numerical value which characterises the *sample* or *population* from which it was derived
### Population (sample set)
A complete set fo items that share at least one property in common that is the subject of a statistical analysis.
### Sample
A *limited number* of observations systematically or (pseudo)randomly selected from a population, whose analysis may yield generalisations about the source population. $\rightarrow$ must be representative
### Statistical estimator
The estimators estimate a population parameter based on sample data
$\overline{x}$




$\rightarrow$ statistics in the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data
### 


- *sample* (event set): $\rightarrow$ must be representative
- *in toto*: in totality


## statistical estimator
- $\mu$ is the population *mean*
- $\overline{x}$ is the sample *mean*
$\rightarrow$ a sample size of 3 is too small to calculate the mean

## Plan an experiment
$\rightarrow$ design your experiment with the data analysis in mind

- minimum number if replicates needed $\rightarrow$ perform a power analysis
- disentangle the influence of confounding variables
- determine the statistical analyses that will be used
- one replicates a treatment/effect on an experimental unit
- the effect needs to be independet on one experimental unit
- replicates need to be independet on one another

## data types

- binary (logical)
- quantitative (discontinuous)
- quantitative (continuous)
- ordinal / ranked
- categorical / nominal

## formulas

- *the (arithmetic) mean*: $$\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$$
- *the (geometric) mean*: 
- *the median*: $\sigma ^2 = \frac{1}{\overline{x}} \sum $
- *the mode*: value that occurs most often (multiple modes possible)
- *concept of central moments* / *central limit theorem*: 

- skewness: 
- kurtosis
- range: 
- population variance: 
- sample variance
- standard deviation
- coefficient of variation
- probability
- frequentists
- baysian
- p value = probability value
- Z-score: $\rightarrow$ standardization 
- EQ: entity qwuality

- random variable:

*The Random Variable*
$\rightarrow$ a variable whose value varies according to chance
$\rightarrow$ each value has an assigned probability

## Various Distributions
*The Student's t distribution*

n = ~ 30
$X \sim f(p_{1} \dots p_{n})$
$X \sim T(\nu)$
$\nu > 0$

*The Discrete Random Variable*
$\rightarrow$ probability mass function

*The Binomial Distribution*
$\rightarrow$ popular discrete variables
$\rightarrow$ Bernoulli distribution: yes / no results

n: number of trials !!!
$\rightarrow$ the one complement: q = 1-p

*The Poisson Distribution* 
$\rightarrow$ discrete probability mass function

## Character

*Covariance*
$\rightarrow$ how do the variances of two variables relate?

*Correlation*
$\rightarrow$ Pearson's coefficient: only linear correlation
- Cov(X,Y)/sx*sy
- cares about values
$\rightarrow$ Spearman's rank coefficient: 
- gives the data ranks
- useful for ordinal data

*Linear Regression*
- y = mx + b
- x is the explainatory factor (independent variable)
- y is the response (dependent variable)
- m is the slope
- b is the intercept

- R2: How much covariation does this model explain
- residual: difference between predicted and observed values
