# An ecologically-flavoured introduction to statistics*

## literature
- Galileo Galilei - Il saggiatore
- Sally Calrdwell - Statisctics unplugged
- ??? - Statistics
- Darrell Huff - How to lie with statistics
- Shannons theory of information (degree of surprise / contrast)

## static
$\rightarrow$ numerical value which characterises the sample or population from which it was derived
$\rightarrow$ statistics in the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data
- *population* (sample set):
- *sample* (event set): \
$\rightarrow$ must be representative
- *in toto*: in totality


## statistical estimator
- $\mu$ is the population *mean*
- $\overline{x}$ is the sample *mean*
$\rightarrow$ a sample size of 3 is too small to calculate the mean

## Plan an experiment
$\rightarrow$ design your experiment with the data analysis in mind
- minimum number if replicates needed $\rightarrow$ perform a power analysis
- disentangle the influence of confounding variables
- determine the statistical analyses that will be used
- one replicates a treatment/effect on an experimental unit
- the effect needs to be independet on one experimental unit
- replicates need to be independet on one another

## data types
- binary (logical)
- quantitative (discontinuous)
- quantitative (continuous)
- ordinal / ranked
- categorical / nominal



## formulas
*the (arithmetic) mean*
$\rightarrow$ multiple means! check!

*the median*: $\sigma ^2 = \frac{1}{\overline{x}} \sum $

*the mode*: value that occurs most often (multiple modes possible)

*concept of central moments* / *central limit theorem*

- skewness: 
- kurtosis
- range: 
- population variance: 
- sample variance
- standard deviation
- coefficient of variation
- probability
- frequentists
- baysian
- p value = probability value
- Z-score
