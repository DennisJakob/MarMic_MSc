ANOSIM exercise 

1) Perform an ANOSIM test on the groups.table.csv, based on the Bray-Curtis distance.
```{r}
library(vegan)
samples <- read.csv("statsII/groups.table.csv",
                    header = T)
samples <- as.data.frame(samples)

# performe ANOSIM
samples.anosim <- anosim(x = samples[,2:4],
                         grouping = samples[,1],
                         permutations = 999,
                         distance = "bray")
summary(samples.anosim)
plot(samples.anosim)
```

2) What do the different R values mean?

3) How is the statistical significance of the R value computed?

4) Make bar plot of the ranked dissimilarities within and between groups.
```{r}

```
