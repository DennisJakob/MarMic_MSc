# introduction

Q: What does the zero say to the eight? 
A: Nice belt!

What is the difference between logic and statistic? 
Logic is a systematic method for getting the wrong conclusion with confidence.
Statistics is a systematic method for getting the wrong conclusion with 95% confidence.

normal distribution is 

$$\alpha = 0.05 \rightarrow 5\%$$ chance of FP type I error
$$1-(1-\alpha)^n$$ is still $\alpha$ for n=1 but gets higher for more n>1

multiple testing problem

hypercube

## aims

### sorting and grouping

nmds
- multidimentional space put into two dimensions

dendrogram
- hierachical cluster analysis

### investigation of dependence (co-variation, dependence)

dependence analysis $\rightarrow$ regression

- two dimensions --> line
- three dimensions --> plane
- four dimensions --> volume

anosim (is similar to anova)

to explain a dependence we build a model (RDA, etc.)

### investigation of correlation
sample matrix --> correlation matrix
drop variables with low variance

## Dissimilarity
everything is dissimilarity, distance is only a subset

dissimilarity matrix
--> dissimilarity value for each pair of samples

similarty coefficient
- simple matching (example of a symmetrical coefficient --> 1,1 0,0)
-- $$\frac{a+d}{a+b+c+d}$$

- jaccard coefficient
-- $$\frac{a}{a+b+c}$$

# Euclidean space
euclidean distance between two points in two dimensional space is a line
often we need non euclidean measures to explain ecological problems

# Bray-Curtis dissimilarity

$$D_{eucledian}=\sqrt{(\sum{y_{1,j}-y_{1,j}})^2}$$
$$D_{Bray-Curtis}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{p}y_{1,j}-y_{2,j}{\sum_{j=1}^{p}(y_{1,j}-y_{2,j})}$$




# PCA

first PCA is the axis that separates the data points the most

pca builds PCs with a combination of linear regressions from the variable

- standardize
- build PCs
- sort PCs 
- plot 

SVD singular value decomposition

# coenospace
- PCA - principal component analysis
- CA - correspondance analysis
